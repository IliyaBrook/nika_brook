            <h3>Soprano - The Highest Female Voice</h3>
            <p>
              Sopranos sing the highest parts in opera and often play the leading female roles. There are several types:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Coloratura Soprano:</strong> The most agile voice type (like myself), capable of complex ornamentations and the highest notes</li>
              <li><strong>Lyric Soprano:</strong> Beautiful, flowing voice perfect for romantic roles</li>
              <li><strong>Dramatic Soprano:</strong> Powerful voice for intense, emotional roles</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.voiceType}>
            <h3>Other Voice Types</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mezzo-Soprano:</strong> Lower female voice, often playing mothers, villains, or trouser roles</li>
              <li><strong>Tenor:</strong> Highest male voice, typically the romantic hero</li>
              <li><strong>Baritone:</strong> Middle male voice, often playing fathers or villains</li>
              <li><strong>Bass:</strong> Lowest male voice, usually older characters or authority figures</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>How to Develop Your Opera Appreciation</h2>
          
          <p>
            Appreciating opera is a journey that deepens over time. Start by focusing on the emotions conveyed through the music, 
            even if you don't understand the language. Notice how the orchestra supports and enhances the singers' emotions. 
            Pay attention to the vocal techniques - the breath control, the way singers shape phrases, and how they use their 
            voices to create character.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a coloratura soprano, I can tell you that every performance is unique. The same aria can feel completely different 
            depending on the singer's interpretation, the conductor's tempo, and even the acoustics of the venue. This is what 
            makes opera a living, breathing art form that continues to captivate audiences after centuries.
